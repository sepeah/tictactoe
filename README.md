# TicTacToe AI â€“ 5x5 Edition

This is a Python-based TicTacToe project developed by **Sepe Ahtosalo**. Contributions are welcome!

## ðŸ§  Background

The original version was created as part of the *Introduction to AI* course at the University of Helsinki 
in 2025. It implemented a basic MinMax algorithm for a standard 3Ã—3 board.

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Version

The game has been expanded to a **5Ã—5 board**, with the objective of connecting **4 in a row**. This 
increases the complexity and depth of the game tree significantly.

### âœ… Features
- MinMax algorithm for decision-making
- Alpha-beta pruning to reduce search space
- move generation favours centerboard for efficiency
- time-out allows for early game moves to be generated.

## ðŸš§ Challenges

Despite pruning, the search tree remains large, especially from an empty board. Time-limit and centerboard-first child generation are far from an ideal.
Changes being considered:

- Implementing a **heuristic evaluation function** to complement terminal state scoring (`-1`, `0`, `1`)
- Implementing a fast check for obvious winning moves (depth 1-2) in case of time-out.

A pygame version with graphics and gameplay against the engine is in the works.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Run

Clone the repository and run the main script to generate a game from an empty board with play(state). 
Use nextmove() to create a single move. See the commented-out section in main.
To change the game situation edit hardcoded game state test_board.
To change the time used to search for a move from 5.0 seconds edit the parameter in nextmove(state, timeout=5.0)

```bash
python main.py
