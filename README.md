# TicTacToe AI â€“ 5x5 Edition

This is a Python-based TicTacToe project developed by **Sepe Ahtosalo**. Contributions are welcome!

## ðŸ§  Background

The original version was created as part of the *Introduction to AI* course at the University of Helsinki 
in 2025. It implemented a basic MinMax algorithm for a standard 3Ã—3 board.

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Version

The game has been expanded to a **5Ã—5 board**, with the objective of connecting **4 in a row**. This 
increases the complexity and depth of the game tree significantly.

### âœ… Features
- MinMax algorithm for decision-making
- Alpha-beta pruning to reduce search space
- move generation favours centerboard for efficiency
- End-game search depth reaches 9 with 13 empty cells in reasonable time

## ðŸš§ Challenges

Despite pruning, the search tree remains large, especially from an empty board. To improve performance 
and enable full-game play, the following enhancements are under consideration:

- Implementing a **heuristic evaluation function** to complement terminal state scoring (`-1`, `0`, `1`)
- A pygame version with graphics and gameplay against the engine


## ðŸ“¦ How to Run

Clone the repository and run the main script to generate a move. To change the starting board edit hardcoded game state test_board:

```bash
python main.py
